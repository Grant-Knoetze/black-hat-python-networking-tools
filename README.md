# black-hat-python-networking-tools
This repository is a showcase of the python skills I am developing using "Black Hat Python" by Justin Seitz and Tim Arnold.
I used VS Code to create, edit, and debug the programs, after which I used Git Bash for windows to initialize this repository, add the files, and then commit the files to this repository.
